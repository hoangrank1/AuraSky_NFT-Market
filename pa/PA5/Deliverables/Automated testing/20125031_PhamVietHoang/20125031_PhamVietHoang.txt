Test automation is a powerful method of using software tools to run and evaluate test cases without human intervention. It is a way to increase the speed, efficiency and accuracy of the testing process. Test automation is particularly useful for regression testing, which is the process of verifying that the system continues to function correctly after changes or updates have been made to it. This is done by re-executing test cases that were previously passed. Test automation can also be used to test large, complex systems that would be impractical or impossible to test manually. This can be achieved by using automation frameworks, and by writing test scripts that can be executed repeatedly. Additionally, test automation allows for parallel testing, which can greatly reduce the overall testing time. However, it is important to note that test automation is not a replacement for manual testing, but it should be used in conjunction with manual testing to ensure comprehensive testing coverage. Test automation is usually applied in projects that have a high regression testing load, or in projects that require a stable codebase to be maintained.
